    <h2>The Library of Babel</h2>
    This is my very first blog and <b>I'm excited</b>
    <p>
        The library of Babel by Borges speaks of a mysterious universe or library that is made up of hexagonal libraries. These hexagons are lined up identical and are infinite, the library contains all books, books from the past and all that will ever be written. Like the internet, the Library of Babel is endless. Each hexagon contains 20 bookshelves. This library is portrayed to be a fascinating location to humankind. There are even conclusions that it is a creation by a God.

        With the library catering for sleeping and the use of a bathroom, there are people who have dedicated most if not all of their lives to exploring it. These people are called the librarians. With a discovery that there are no two books which are identical, there has been a revelation that there are books that contain the secrets of life as well as personal vindications.
